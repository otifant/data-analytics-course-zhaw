It is one issue that I feel very strongly about and at the same time makes me angry: violence against women. Let's note: According to the Federal Statistical Office, between 2009 and 2016, nearly 600 attempted and committed homicides were registered in the domestic field. That's an average of 75 per year. At the same time, we know that women are almost four times more likely to be victims than men, and the proportion of women killed is seven times higher. Not in the favelas of South America, nor in big cities in the USA, but in Switzerland - and among us. The fight against this is proving difficult; because contact points are overburdened or the police can only intervene when it is often already too late. In the latter case, a small device for victims of violent crime is soon to promise improvement. (Brun, 2023).\n","\n","**Reference**\n","\n","Brun, I.(2023).
