Here's a brief overview of when to use each of them:\n","\n","**Line charts**: Line charts are useful for showing **trends over time** or for comparing the changes in two or more variables. They are particularly effective for displaying continuous data that is ordered by time or some other sequence. Line charts are also useful for displaying patterns or trends in data sets with a large number of data points.\n","\n","**Distribution charts**: Distribution charts, also known as histogram charts or frequency charts, are useful for displaying the **distribution of a single variable**. They show the number of observations that fall into different intervals or \"bins\" of the variable. Distribution charts are particularly useful for identifying patterns in data sets with a large number of data points, or for displaying the shape of the distribution of a variable.\n","\n","**Scatter plots**: Scatter plots are useful for **displaying the relationship between two variables**. They show how the values of one variable change in response to changes in the values of another variable. Scatter plots are particularly useful for identifying patterns or trends in data sets with a **large number of data points**, or for identifying **outliers** or unusual data points.\n","\n","**Pair plot** charts: Pair plot charts, also known as scatterplot matrices, are useful for **displaying the relationship between multiple variables**. They show scatter plots of all possible combinations of pairs of variables in a data set. Pair plot charts are particularly useful for identifying patterns or trends in complex data sets with multiple variables, or for identifying relationships between variables that may not be immediately apparent from individual scatter plots.\n","\n","‚ö†Ô∏è <font color=blue>In general, the choice of chart type depends on the **type of data** you have and the **questions you want to answer** with your visualization.

Here's a brief overview of some of the most common types of charts and what each chart is used for:\n","\n","**Bar charts**: Bar charts are used to display the **distribution of categorical data**. They are often used to compare the frequency or proportion of different categories or groups.\n","\n","Line charts: Line charts are used to display trends in data over time. They are often used to show changes in a variable over a period of time or to compare the performance of two or more variables over time.\n","\n","Scatter plots: Scatter plots are used to display the relationship between two continuous variables. They are often used to identify patterns or trends in the data and to identify any outliers or unusual data points.\n","\n","Pie charts: Pie charts are used to display the proportion of a whole that is accounted for by each category or group. They are often used to display the relative sizes of different categories or groups.\n","\n","Area charts: Area charts are similar to line charts but display the area between the line and the x-axis. They are often used to display changes in a variable over time or to compare the performance of two or more variables over time.\n","\n","**Box plots**: Box plots are used to display the **distribution of continuous data**. They show the median, quartiles, and any **outliers** in the data.\n","\n","Histograms: Histograms are used to display the distribution of continuous data. They show the frequency or proportion of observations that fall into different intervals or \"bins\" of the variable.\n","\n","**Heat maps**: Heat maps are used to display the **relationship between two categorical variables**.

It can be hard to determine the exact differences between two slices of a pie chart, especially if the slices are similar in size or color.\n","\n","‚ö†Ô∏è  Limited number of slices: Pie charts are best used for showing data with a small number of categories. As the number of categories increases, the chart becomes more cluttered and difficult to read.\n","\n","‚ö†Ô∏è  Limited precision: Pie charts are not as precise as other charts, such as bar graphs or line graphs, because they do not show the exact numerical values of the data.\n","\n","‚ö†Ô∏è Misleading: Pie charts can be misleading if the slices are not accurately sized or labeled. It is important to ensure that the slices are proportional to the data they represent and that they are labeled clearly.\n","\n","Overall, while pie charts can be visually appealing, they may not always be the most effective way to represent data.
