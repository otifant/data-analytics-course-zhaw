# Project guidelines

Put your project notebook file(s) in this directory.

You can use the project template notebook to structure your project but the rest of the project should be your own creation.

You should be able to explain each line of code in your project. In other words, while you can google up snippets of code or re-use some code segments from the course, you should be able to explain each line of code.

# Timeline

# Deadline 1: dataset

The topic and dataset should be submitted by week 3 the latest.

# Deadline 2: project notebook

The project notebook should be submitted by week 5 and defended in class in week 6.

I encourage you to pre-submit iterations of your project during the class in order to get feedback and improve your code before your final submition.

For your final submit, use "final" as your submit message.
